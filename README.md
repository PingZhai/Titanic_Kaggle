# Titanic_Kaggle
preprocessing_features_find_relative_survive_rate.py: This program preprocesses the raw data. It calculates the correlation coefficient between features and survival rate. Using the correlation coefficients information, we can choose what features to be included to train the machine learning model.   

titanic_predict.py: This program uses preprocessed data to train the machine learning model, and predict the survival number.
